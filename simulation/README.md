# Simulation Pipeline <!-- omit from toc -->

Cheng did the simulation for this paper in Blender as the CLOTH3D dataset is setup for this simulation already.
He shared his repository for simulation with me and I'll be moving here as I sort through what is necessary for simulation as there's lots of code in the repo.

## Accessing The CLOTH3D Dataset

Cheng wrote utiltity functions for reading the CLOTH3D dataset in `cloth_3d_util`.

- The function for reading the data is in the `cloth_3d_util.accessor::Cloth3DCanonicalAccessor` class.
